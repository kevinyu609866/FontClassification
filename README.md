# FontClassification

Contained in this repository is the code written in R for classifying three different types of fonts with multiple machine learning models.

The fonts used are: BOOK, COMIC, and MISTRAL found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00417/.
Each data set has 412 columns features along with a total number of observed cases of 2668, 2388, and 2612 cases respectively. Each image is 20 by 20, denoting 400 pixels.
Thus, each case contains numeric values of between 0 to 255, denoting the “gray level” of the pixels. Collectively, the 400 numeric values, gives us an image.
